0005-001.png	NATURE is the most beautiful #thing ,
0005-002.png	I've  ever seen . It #inspire me a lot
0005-003.png	and it also motivates me . As we
0005-004.png	look at four different #seasons of the
0005-005.png	year , we come to know that all
0005-006.png	of these seasons have their own
0005-007.png	significance , like Spring is the season of
0005-008.png	rebirth . It gives us hope of new beginnings
0005-009.png	whenever we feel tired #or dejected . Similarly ,
0005-010.png	summer gives us the perspective of #maturity .
0005-011.png	Every fruit #or vegetable #gets mature
0005-012.png	and old in summer and is ready to
0005-013.png	be plucked up . Autumn is also a #season
0005-014.png	of hope , when old leaves fall down #into
0005-015.png	the ground . It #reminds us of our miseries that
0005-016.png	all miseries and #hardships have to end one
0005-017.png	day . Winter is a beautiful section of all ,
0005-018.png	When #everything dies away , a symbol of #mortality .
0006-000.png	We are all hollow men . We have
0006-001.png	eyes but we # # do not
0006-002.png	have the vision to see the reality
0006-003.png	of # life . We depend on each
0006-004.png	other in every aspect of life . we
0006-005.png	do not have the courage to
0006-006.png	take a decision by # ourselves and
0006-007.png	stand on our decision . We # learned
0006-008.png	from our mistakes , but when time
0006-009.png	passes we do the same mistake
0006-010.png	again . # Justice is banished from
0006-011.png	# this world . We only identify
0006-012.png	faults in others . We do not look
0006-013.png	the positive side of other . We #
0006-014.png	# are the Puppets who depends
0006-015.png	on other . We # have brain but
0006-016.png	we do not use it , we #
0006-017.png	# # can not use it properly .
0007-000.png	In every age or time , there
0007-001.png	are goodness and badness ,
0007-002.png	intelligence and stupidity , faith
0007-003.png	and doubt . # There are
0007-004.png	knowledge and ignorance , #

0007-006.png	and every society represents
0007-007.png	both aspects of life  i-e
0007-008.png	evil and goodness . Now it
0007-009.png	is upto human whether to
0007-010.png	# choose good path or
0007-011.png	bad . We should recognize ourselves
0007-012.png	# we should recognize our
0007-013.png	motives and # the reality of
0007-014.png	life . Our choices are very

0010-003.png	nation or one's country completly ,
0010-004.png	because each and every country
0010-005.png	where there is corruption #

0010-008.png	# # countries which is
0010-009.png	more # then 50 People
0010-010.png	were involve in poverty . So in
0010-011.png	Pakistan corruption is in #
0010-012.png	peak , because # each and

0011-001.png	The poem # takes the reader

0011-008.png	he goes through a series of
0011-009.png	metaphorical transformation in which
0011-010.png	he's eaten by white #
0011-011.png	leopards and made to climb

0017-000.png	First of all we are a

0017-007.png	reason # is a bitter reality which

0018-000.png	( Summery )
0018-001.png	From this sentence ( can a Pakistan
0018-002.png	India match really help us be friend )
0018-003.png	Actually India and Pakistan may or
0018-004.png	may not be a good or bed friends
0018-005.png	to each others but they can be close
0018-006.png	with each other through the match .
0018-007.png	Because this a chance for both
0018-008.png	sit down for a while to remove the
0018-009.png	# problems . But I think this is
0018-010.png	also a problem # # creating
0018-011.png	match , because both wants to win
0018-012.png	the match If one side win and
0018-013.png	second one not that they hate those
0018-014.png	who win , Its mean there is no
0018-015.png	way from which # make friend
0018-016.png	to each others .
0019-000.png	Often we see Indian and Pakistani cricketers
0019-001.png	screaming in front of cameras . They # show that
0019-002.png	how emotional they are and also they belong to
0019-003.png	emotional # countries . Eastern countries are mostly
0019-004.png	considered as emotional but it is entirely #
0019-005.png	subjective claim and there is no science behind it .
0019-006.png	But the question here is that how this precreption get
0019-007.png	developed ? This question can be answered by the #
0019-008.png	concept giving by Edward said in his book and the
0019-009.png	# series of lectures which he had given in America ,
0019-010.png	in a book called Orientalism . He # emphasized
0019-011.png	that how Western critics , writers think inferior of
0019-012.png	Eastern world . He stated that Western countries thought
0019-013.png	ill and had developed stereotypes to distort and
0019-014.png	denounce Eastern world . On contary Western # #
0019-015.png	critics introduced the idea of Occidentalism , which
0019-016.png	is the antithesis of Orientalism . They said that
0019-017.png	Edward said ignored this concept that Eastern world
0019-018.png	always copy Western World in all regards of life .
0020-000.png	Online Education , In 2020 the student
0020-001.png	can sufer because # they can # not
0020-002.png	attend# the regular classes . They attend
0020-003.png	the online classes . The online
0020-004.png	classes have the same advantages and
0020-005.png	# disadvantages . The advantages is that
0020-006.png	the student can attend the classe in every time ,
0020-007.png	and place . But the disadvantages is that
0020-008.png	the student # # donot work
0020-009.png	properly for exam # and cannot
0020-010.png	give full attention for the

0021-000.png	Awakening the sense :-
0021-001.png	Our perception of the physical world
0021-002.png	is dependent on our sense of

0021-004.png	smell . Touch is the # Ist sense that
0021-005.png	develops in newborns and remains #
0021-006.png	one of the most ultimate and
0021-007.png	emotional of the senses throughout
0021-008.png	our lives . The most mysterious
0021-009.png	and evocative is the sense of
0021-010.png	smell . It is the most primitive
0021-011.png	of the senses , with a direct
0021-012.png	pathway to the brain's long-term
0021-013.png	memory . A smell can # trigger

0034-000.png	Choice of Career
0034-001.png	The choicce od carer is indeed the
0034-002.png	toughest thing in life . The main reasson
0034-003.png	behind it is the trend and general
0034-004.png	scope of any field . Morever , the
0034-005.png	choice of career depends upon the
0034-006.png	interest , which if not identified properly
0034-007.png	becoms a source of displacemnt after
0034-008.png	somtimes . Daydreaming . over expectition
0034-009.png	and unrealistic goals distract one from
0034-010.png	ones dream job . Therefore all these
0034-011.png	factors must to considerd beyond
0034-012.png	personal preferrence . The students that if
0034-013.png	interest in reading and writting then they
0034-014.png	should go for Library science and teaching
0034-015.png	if they are interested in the Mathematics
0034-016.png	and numeracy then it is better for them to
0034-017.png	chose accounting and finance as

0035-005.png	state come into being when #
0035-006.png	come the punjab and #

0035-017.png	destroyed many a wall-established

0036-000.png	The secret of successful life is
0036-001.png	# summed up in self-reverence ,
0036-003.png	control . A man who #
0036-004.png	does not respect himself will
0036-005.png	# never be respected by
0036-006.png	others . If he fails to achieve
0036-007.png	# a certain height # and
0036-008.png	goes about with his head
0036-009.png	hanging down , people will think
0036-010.png	him # weak and cowardly .
0036-011.png	He should have the courage to
0036-012.png	hold # his head high in
0036-013.png	spite of his failures . We
0036-014.png	# never overrate ourselves .
0036-015.png	We # never exceed our power .
0036-016.png	Self control is even #
0036-017.png	more important than the

0037-004.png	erial . Presently seven billion & six million

0045-001.png	we can say that water is a very
0045-002.png	good solvent .
0045-003.png	sugar , rock salt and sodium bicarbonate
0045-004.png	( meetha soda ) , etc dissolve in water .
0045-005.png	Milk , alcohol , lemon juice , vinegar and
0045-006.png	apple juice dissolve in water .
0045-007.png	The food we eat forms a solution in the
0045-008.png	body and then absorbs in the blood .
0045-009.png	Many harmful substances are produced
0045-010.png	in our body # . These subtances
0045-011.png	dissolve in water and excrete as

0046-002.png	our constitution because we have to
0046-003.png	# amendment some of our laws
0046-004.png	like our taxes structure . So we have to
0046-005.png	reforms our tax structure and its connection
0046-006.png	to the forigen aid . Because the cost rates
0046-007.png	depends on the international business and

0047-000.png	India is trying for the # recognition of
0047-001.png	Kashmir by UN Security Council as a

0047-003.png	its control over kashmir .
0047-004.png	Unfortunately UNSC is powerless to #
0047-005.png	stop India because some of its members
0047-006.png	donot want # to do so .
0047-007.png	Therefore kashmiris and International
0047-008.png	supporters should raise this issue and most # prominent platform both
0047-009.png	through institution# like UN and through media . Kashmiris
0047-010.png	are so fed up that they have started protesting for thier
0047-011.png	freedom . But India regards such actions as terrorist
0047-012.png	activities to prove there action illegal .
0047-013.png	Institutional suppoters # of kashmiris should

0048-000.png	We know that many solids dissolve
0048-001.png	when # are put into liquids . When #
0048-002.png	somethings dissolves , it forms a # solution . A
0048-003.png	solution is a homogenous mixture of two or
0048-004.png	more components . The mixture of salt and
0048-005.png	water is a solution . We use many solution
0048-006.png	Everyday .
0048-007.png	All solution are the mixture of two or
0048-008.png	more substances . The substances in less #
0048-009.png	amount is called solute . The substance in
0048-010.png	which solute is dissolved is called solvent .
0048-011.png	The solvent is always more is quantity
0048-012.png	than a # salute . Can you explain
0048-013.png	solute and solvent in a solution of salt
0048-014.png	and water ?
0048-015.png	Solvent + solute - solution .

0052-000.png	Taking a proper nutrition & walking
0052-001.png	can help a person to lose weight .
0052-002.png	The condition required for a person
0052-003.png	to lose weight through walking is
0052-004.png	that # he needs to walk regularly
0052-005.png	as well as with proper intensity .
0052-006.png	As ACSM recommends that a person
0052-007.png	can gain his aim of losing weight
0052-008.png	by walking 4-5 days for one
0052-009.png	hour continuously . Any additional excercise
0052-010.png	can help in fitness level of body .
0052-011.png	During # exercise our heart rate
0052-012.png	must increase to moderate level
0052-013.png	and we can measure it through
0052-014.png	heart #rate monitor . walking provide
0052-015.png	benefits to every age people including
0052-016.png	old as well as # adults .
0053-000.png	we see in our society , womens are just limited
0053-001.png	to their homes . They are mostly depend upon
0053-002.png	their males even for a minor things . In our pakista-
0053-003.png	ni society they are not allowed to go outside
0053-004.png	to earn money , especially in our pashtoon
0053-005.png	society. So this kind of things was very
0053-006.png	common when there was no education , but
0053-007.png	now a days when education becomes commo-
0053-008.png	on especially girls education this kind of
0053-009.png	problem have been reduced . Now its Our 1st
0053-010.png	need to overcome these kind of problems
0053-011.png	that a women's face in their day to day
0053-012.png	life . we can # overcome these problems throu-

0054-002.png	encodes his/her messages while receiver
0054-003.png	decodes a specific information .
0054-004.png	Now , I introduce the concept
0054-005.png	of word i-e words are syntactic
0054-006.png	units , means words # are the
0054-007.png	unit of syntax . Further, words
0054-008.png	can be classifid into two broad
0054-009.png	classes ;
0054-010.png	# Open class words
0054-011.png	# Closed class words
0054-012.png	Open class words :

0055-000.png	My Favourite Personlity :-
0055-001.png	Allama Iqbal is my favourite Personality
0055-002.png	because he was a great Poet and as well
0055-003.png	as a scholar . # # # #
0055-004.png	dreams of Quaid-e-Azam . Because of
0055-005.png	his struggle we are get a good
0055-006.png	education and we should try to make
0055-007.png	ourselves # like him . Now when
0055-008.png	we read his books # we are
0055-009.png	very impress from him . Why because
0055-010.png	# in that time he was very
0055-011.png	struggle for their future & as well as
0055-012.png	for our future . Now we should try

0056-000.png	Mathematics is a subject using mathematics
0056-001.png	rules and principal we make our
0056-002.png	life easier . By using trigonometry we
0056-003.png	made mobile applications and # this
0056-004.png	applications make our life easier .
0056-005.png	We also use mathematics in our daily
0056-006.png	life for example in shops # for
0056-007.png	culculating porpose , in biological experiment ,
0056-008.png	in physics for soloving numericls proplems
0056-009.png	we use mathematics rules .
0056-010.png	Mathematics is a unique and nice subject .
0056-011.png	In Mathematics we study about calculating ,
0056-012.png	geometry , trignometry , conics etc .
0056-013.png	# Addition , Subtraction , division and
0056-014.png	multiplication these are simply use in
0056-015.png	everyday life .
0056-016.png	Without these our life are not easy .
0056-017.png	By using these our life is easier .
0057-000.png	Mathematics :- Mathematics is the branch
0057-001.png	which deals with the
0057-002.png	the study of sets , structure , geometory
0057-003.png	and etc .
0057-004.png	# Sir M'm actualy my aim
0057-005.png	was I have army officer as a
0057-006.png	commission officer . but unfortunately
0057-007.png	when I have pass the SSC
0057-008.png	exam . # the commission officer applied
0057-009.png	are so late . So I have decision
0057-010.png	to my own family & other friends .
0057-011.png	he guided to me . you are join
0057-012.png	the university in your favourite
0057-013.png	subject . I have # apply to many
0057-014.png	universities likes as QAU , UOP , ICU
0057-015.png	and KUST . first of choice QAU , second
0057-016.png	of my choice UOP & Third of my
0057-017.png	choice ICU . The first two universities .
0058-000.png	Mathematics is the branch of science which
0058-001.png	deals with the adding and substracting a
0058-002.png	numbers . Mathematics is those subject
0058-003.png	which use all over the world . In
0058-004.png	everywhere which i see they have use
0058-005.png	mathematics . Just like a build the
0058-006.png	# a house or other building ,
0058-007.png	first we draw a map , that how
0058-008.png	we # construct the building .
0058-009.png	In everywhere I see , the mathematics
0058-010.png	is used . That is why this #
0058-011.png	subject ( Mathematics ) is called
0058-012.png	father of all language and and
0058-013.png	mother of Science . Mathematics is not
0058-014.png	just adding and subtracting etc numbers ,
0058-015.png	It have many functions just like series
0058-016.png	sequence and # many other functions .
0059-000.png	Mathematics is the mother
0059-001.png	of Science . Maths is so
0059-002.png	easy subject . I am
0059-003.png	doing Bs in maths , I like
0059-004.png	math very much . But those
0059-005.png	students whos are not interested
0059-006.png	in math they Fell sorry and
0059-007.png	Found it very hard subject .
0059-008.png	Actually maths is not so hard
0059-009.png	and tough # but their
0059-010.png	teacher's and socity make
0059-011.png	their minds that's why the
0059-012.png	student did not like math
0059-013.png	as a subject . When you
0059-014.png	have a good teacher and
0059-015.png	provide a best environment #
0059-016.png	# it is so easy I love
0059-017.png	maths .
0060-000.png	MATHEMATICS
0060-001.png	According to our some teachers
0060-002.png	Mathematics stands for :
0060-003.png	M : Matrix theory
0060-004.png	A : Algebra T : Trignometry
0060-005.png	H : Hibert space E : Ergodicity
0060-006.png	M : Measure theory A : Analysis
0060-007.png	T : Topology I : Integration
0060-008.png	C : Computer numbers S : Set theory .
0060-009.png	I like the mathematics
0060-010.png	because I can easily undestand
0060-011.png	it . After passing my F.sc exam
0060-012.png	many peoples disappointed
0060-013.png	me about my choice
0060-014.png	( Mathematics ) . But i # still
0060-015.png	like the mathematics and
0060-016.png	inshallah I will show then mathematics is something .
0061-000.png	Mathematics
0061-001.png	Mathematics is the study of
0061-002.png	numbers i.e Real number , Rational number ,
0061-003.png	irrational number etc . Mathematics
0061-004.png	is the branch of science . Mathematics
0061-005.png	is the major subject . In every
0061-006.png	field their is Mathematics include .
0061-007.png	without Mathematics any subject i.e
0061-008.png	physics , Biology , chemistry , Medical etc , are
0061-009.png	not complete# .
0061-010.png	So i #come to addmission
0061-011.png	in Bs Mathematics in Islamia
0061-012.png	college university Peshawar . I want
0061-013.png	to became a Mathematician . Mathematics
0061-014.png	is much difficult I try do
0061-015.png	hard work . Mathematics is one of
0061-016.png	the best subject . Mathematics
0061-017.png	include algebra , function , calculus ,
0061-018.png	mathematical logic etc .
0062-000.png	Mathematics is the mother of science .
0062-001.png	Mathematics is wide subjects .
0062-002.png	I # like Mathematics very much . It is
0062-003.png	very interesting . Basically I am doing
0062-004.png	BS Mathematics from from Islamia colleg#e
0062-005.png	Peshawar . In Mathematics we # are
0062-006.png	studying different Topics . we derive
0062-007.png	new equations . Mathematics is very
0062-008.png	Tough . Some people don't like
0062-009.png	Mathematics . It makes our brain fresh .
0062-010.png	Actually Mathematics is # not very
0062-011.png	tough but our # society . makes
0062-012.png	their minds # that's why the
0062-013.png	students didn't like Mathematics .
0062-014.png	when you have a good teacher and
0062-015.png	provide a fresh environment Then
0062-016.png	it is very easy .
0062-017.png	I Love Maths .
0063-000.png	Mathimatics is the system of
0063-001.png	numbers , combined by basic
0063-002.png	or binary operation . In short
0063-003.png	short mathematics is mother of
0063-004.png	all language . Because whole science
0063-005.png	depends on mathematics . As
0063-006.png	Computers program is made
0063-007.png	up of maths equations . Almost
0063-008.png	it is used in each and
0063-009.png	every branch of science .
0063-010.png	Basic mathimatics is important
0063-011.png	for a students of mathimatics .
0063-012.png	Maths make our daily life
0063-013.png	very easy , as when we
0063-014.png	go to a shopkeeper . Those
0063-015.png	word that we use in our
0063-016.png	daily life is all maths .
0064-000.png	Every where we find " x " like we
0064-001.png	treat mathematics .
0064-002.png	Let # F be a function
0064-003.png	of two variables such that
0064-004.png	x and y in which we
0064-005.png	have to find its slops ,
0064-006.png	graphs , and you have to
0064-007.png	draw a table for it .
0064-008.png	Also the two equation
0064-009.png	are given and we have
0064-010.png	to find the value of
0064-011.png	x and y by using
0064-012.png	graph methods . In the
0064-013.png	# question they # # # given
0064-014.png	a data and according to
0064-015.png	the given data we have
0064-016.png	to find a suitable solution
0064-017.png	for it .
0065-000.png	Let F be a function of two
0065-001.png	Variables , such that F has
0065-002.png	continous first partial derivatives
0065-003.png	in a domain D . The total
0065-004.png	differential dF is #
0065-005.png	defined by the formula .
0065-006.png	The expression # is
0065-007.png	called an exact differential
0065-008.png	in a domain D if there exists
0065-009.png	a function F of two variables
0065-010.png	such that this expression equals
0065-011.png	the total differential .
0065-012.png	The dependant variable y and
0065-013.png	its varrious derivatives occurs
0065-014.png	to the 1st degree only .
0066-000.png	In mathematics , a function is a
0066-001.png	binary relation between two sets
0066-002.png	that associated each element of
0066-003.png	the first set to exactly one
0066-004.png	element of the Second set .
0066-005.png	Typical examples are functions from
0066-006.png	integers to integers , or from
0066-007.png	the real numbers to #
0066-008.png	real numbers .
0066-009.png	Functions were origanally the
0066-010.png	idealization of how a varing
0066-011.png	quantity depends on another
0066-012.png	quantity . For example , the
0066-013.png	position of a planet in
0066-014.png	a function of time , A
0066-015.png	function is a process or a
0066-016.png	relation # that associates
0066-017.png	each element x of a set X .
0067-000.png	Function :-
0067-001.png	In function there is for
0067-002.png	domain there is # only
0067-003.png	Unique y # which is range
0067-004.png	for domain . There are #
0067-005.png	some types of function . When
0067-006.png	every element in domain have
0067-007.png	unique value then it is one-one
0067-008.png	function . if # for domain there
0067-009.png	is more then one values in
0067-010.png	in y mean range then this type
0067-011.png	of function is called onto

0067-013.png	examples :- there are two boys . and
0067-014.png	we have one apple and
0067-015.png	one orange one of each #chooses
0067-016.png	just one apple then it is one-one
0067-017.png	function . if the man chooses both
0067-018.png	apple and orange the it is
0067-019.png	called # non-one-one . or onto function
0068-000.png	Function :
0068-001.png	The term " function " is
0068-002.png	mostly used in mathematics . It
0068-003.png	is a rule that assign two
0068-004.png	value of any two sets . The
0068-005.png	sets must be non-empty . Set A
0068-006.png	will be our domain and set
0068-007.png	B plays the role of range .
0068-008.png	There must not be repatition
0068-009.png	in the domain of a
0068-010.png	function , and every value of
0068-011.png	the domain should be mapped
0068-012.png	with some element of the
0068-013.png	range . Sometimes set B is
0068-014.png	called co-domain . Only those
0068-015.png	elements of co-domain will
0068-016.png	be in the set of range
0068-017.png	which should take part in
0068-018.png	the mapping .

0092-000.png	PHYCOLOGY
0092-001.png	Phycology is actually the
0092-002.png	study of algae .
0092-003.png	This term phycology is derived from two
0092-004.png	words " phyko " which is a Greek word
0092-005.png	means seaweed and " logos " means to
0092-006.png	study .
0092-007.png	Algae is a collative term for all

0093-007.png	have occured in these animals This
0093-008.png	Concept is called # organic evolution #
0093-009.png	It is defined as Decent with
0093-010.png	modifications through times
0093-011.png	Evolution indeed is occurring but the process
0093-012.png	is # too slow to be #observal . The example
0093-013.png	of evolutionary #change is that os rabbits
0093-014.png	which # were released early in the
0093-015.png	fifteenth century on a # small island .

0137-017.png	Stain that can be
0137-018.png	applied on living cell's with killing them .
0138-000.png	Plasma Membra#n
0138-001.png	It is the outer most layer of animal
0138-002.png	cell and present beneth the plant cell wall .
0138-003.png	cell membrane is chamically composed of
0138-004.png	60 - 80 protein
0138-005.png	20 - 40 lipids
0138-006.png	and small amount of carbohydrate is
0138-007.png	present .
0138-008.png	There are #different model#s # proposed
0138-009.png	by many scientist but the
0138-010.png	most acceptable modele is
0138-011.png	fluid mosic modle .
0138-012.png	Statement :- " lipid by layer is a sea
0138-013.png	and many proteins are embaded
0138-014.png	in the layer . "
0138-015.png	There are many type of protein
0138-016.png	present inside the plasma membrane
0138-017.png	such us Intarnsic protein , Periperal protein
0138-018.png	etc .
0139-000.png	Selection of the plant tissue ( explant ) from
0139-001.png	a healthy vigorous mother plant cell .
0139-002.png	This is # often the apical bad but
0139-003.png	can be other tissue .
0139-004.png	This tissue must be sterillized to remove
0139-005.png	microbial # domin#ants .
0139-006.png	The shoot are tranafered to a growth
0139-007.png	medium with relatively h#igher auxin
0139-008.png	cytokinine ratio which result in the

0141-000.png	Chromatography :-
0141-001.png	Chromatography is a mean
0141-002.png	of separating one type of molecule
0141-003.png	from others it # involves moving
0141-004.png	the mixture , normally as a gas , over
0141-005.png	a stationary phase embedded in
0141-006.png	cellulose or silica . The separation
0141-007.png	may depend on a range of chemical
0141-008.png	and physical properties of the
0141-009.png	molecules such as solubility and
0141-010.png	molecules mass . Essentially there are
0141-011.png	two basic ways of carrying out the
0141-012.png	seqaration .
0142-000.png	Tissue Culture :-
0142-001.png	Tissue culture is the growth of tissue
0142-002.png	and cells separate from the organism .
0142-003.png	This is typically facilitated by the use of
0142-004.png	liquid semi-solid growth medium such as
0142-005.png	broth , or agar . Tissue culture produce clones
0142-006.png	in which all the product cells have the same
0142-007.png	genotypes unless affected by mutation during
0142-008.png	culture . In the following section a list of
0142-009.png	apparatus and main steps of tissue culture

0174-009.png	setting in his world that's familiar to the

0174-011.png	From talking objects to dead characters to

0174-013.png	that do not #occur in this world . However ,

0175-013.png	responsible for such terriorist like things .
0175-014.png	But it's was not the case , Because
0175-015.png	Islam denies such kind of in-human
0175-016.png	attitude in the world . Islam want peace
0175-017.png	and humanity in all over the
0175-018.png	world .
0176-000.png	As according to the novel

0178-000.png	Postolonial literature usually focuses
0178-001.png	the present and the past effects of
0178-002.png	the colonizers both on social
0178-003.png	and political level . One of the
0178-004.png	best examples of postcolonial
0178-005.png	fiction ( literature ) is , which highlights
0178-006.png	different features of post-
0178-007.png	colonialism . In his work " One

0179-001.png	writer , has bombarded his novel  " One hundred
0179-002.png	years od solitude " with a multitude of
0179-003.png	post-modern fiction elements throughout the
0179-004.png	novel . We find features such as
0179-005.png	magical realism ,  concept where we see
0179-006.png	a blend of both the supernatural and
0179-007.png	fantastic with a hint of realism imbued
0179-008.png	within it at some level . furthermore ,
0179-009.png	we also see the features of
0179-010.png	inter-textuality in the form of pastiche
0179-011.png	( works that are inspired by the works
0179-012.png	of other writers ) . Finally we may
0179-013.png	highlight element  of time that
0179-014.png	is portrayed in this novel from start
0179-015.png	to finish of the novel . we see time
0179-016.png	in ways such as ; linear progression ,
0179-017.png	random jumps two difficult events and
0179-018.png	certain instances where time staays completely still .

0181-000.png	Magical realism is a prominent genre of literature
0181-001.png	that is defined by the presence of magical elements
0181-002.png	within a realistic worldly setting , thereby effectively
0181-003.png	combining fantasy with reality . The overall concept
0181-004.png	was mainly developed and popularized in latin
0181-005.png	America where notalbe writers such as Isabelle
0181-006.png	Allende and Gabriel Garcia Marquez utilized it
0181-007.png	to comment upon the tumultouus socail and
0181-008.png	political conditions of the region . It is mainly
0181-009.png	characterized by a sense of heightered mystery
0181-010.png	and general ambiguity concerning the nature of
0181-011.png	Magic . In addition , the narrative is typically
0181-012.png	geared towards addressing real-life issues . In
0181-013.png	this manner , the stories act as allegorical and
0181-014.png	symbolic critiques of #societal at affairs . Lastly ,
0181-015.png	the literary works tend to move away from
0181-016.png	the typical plot structure with a clear exposition ,
0181-017.png	climax and resolution .
0182-000.png	Tragedy is the imitation of an action that is
0182-001.png	complete in its magnitude written # with
0182-002.png	pleasurable accessories brought out separatly
0182-003.png	in separate part , in a language which
0182-004.png	is dailogue or dramatic and not the
0182-005.png	narrative one , having events # arous-
0182-006.png	ing pity and fear where with to attain
0182-007.png	with the catharsis of these emotions
0182-008.png	The basic purpose of tragedy , according
0182-009.png	to Aristotle , To give pleasure and this
0182-010.png	Pleasure is higher on the contrary
0182-011.png	the pleasure provided by comedy
0182-012.png	is lower or baser . But , if literature
0182-013.png	or specifically tragedy is providing
0182-014.png	you with morality , it is an extra
0182-015.png	plus and not the basic purpose of
0182-016.png	the # genre . And all this is
0182-017.png	discusssion in Poetics .
0183-000.png	Post-modernism is the age around 20th
0183-001.png	century , in which we particularly
0183-002.png	study about the texts , works which
0183-003.png	is written after World war 2 and
0183-004.png	the writers of that age are particularly
0183-005.png	known as post-modernists .
0183-006.png	Some of the features or characteristics
0183-007.png	of this era are ; Magical Realism ,
0183-008.png	Inter-texuality and science development
0183-009.png	or Science destruction etc .
0183-010.png	Magical Realism is about the
0183-011.png	things which are seem to be real
0183-012.png	but they are not . Such as in the
0183-013.png	novel " One hundred years of Solitude "
0183-014.png	we see that most of the things
0183-015.png	or events are explained or shown
0183-016.png	as that they are real but in
0183-017.png	reality that totally based on fiction
0183-018.png	and fantastical things / elements .
0184-000.png	Post colonial is that work / literature shares
0184-001.png	the experience of colonialism in writing and
0184-002.png	also discusses the present and post effects
0184-003.png	on social and political level they were so
0184-004.png	much rude , they were very proud , Exploitation ,
0184-005.png	Racism , separation is highlighted in the
0184-006.png	writing . Post colonialism is a broad culture
0184-007.png	approach the study of power relations
0184-008.png	between groups , cultures or people in which
0184-009.png	language , literature play role . It tell us
0184-010.png	about the inequalities which we can see

0185-007.png	generations of Buendia family , who
0185-008.png	ruled but swept away and were
0185-009.png	never remembered . At that time , Columbia
0185-010.png	was under civil war and voilence for
0185-011.png	about half century . It was suffered
0185-012.png	by Imperialism of west . Macondo

0186-000.png	Stytistics can trace its roots to the
0186-001.png	formalist tradition that developed in
0186-002.png	Russian theory at the turn of the 20th
0186-003.png	century , particularly in the work of the
0186-004.png	Moscow linguistic circle . Its most famous
0186-005.png	member Id and the most well-known
0186-006.png	exponent of Russian formalism was
0186-007.png	Roman Jakobson , whose work focused
0186-008.png	on defining the qualities of what he
0186-009.png	termed ' poetic language ' . The poetic language
0186-010.png	of function is realised in those communication
0186-011.png	acts where the focuses is an message
0186-012.png	for its own sake I as opposed , say , to
0186-013.png	a communicative act focused on conversing
0186-014.png	the emotions of the speakers . Jakobson's
0186-015.png	work was to have tremendous influence
0186-016.png	on the development of stytistic , not
0186-017.png	least as a result of his varied academic
0186-018.png	career and the opportunities .

0188-000.png	The title of novel is very wisely
0188-001.png	chosen by Gabriel Garia Marqueiz . The title
0188-002.png	depicted the whole plot of a novel in just
0188-003.png	a few words . We will individually analyze
0188-004.png	the meaning of important terms in the litle
0188-005.png	and than we will explain it according to
0188-006.png	the context of the novel . The first word of
0188-007.png	the title " One hundred years " is referring to
0188-008.png	the total time span of Buendia family . The
0188-009.png	generation of Buendia family consisted of one
0188-010.png	century that includes the future generation
0188-011.png	as well . The second important word in the
0188-012.png	title is " solitude " , solitude is different from
0188-013.png	loneliness , loneliness is a negative state marked
0188-014.png	by isolation . One feel something is missing ,
0188-015.png	even among a huge crowd one may feel
0188-016.png	loneliness . While solitude is a positive state
0188-017.png	where one give him / herself a great plenty
0188-018.png	of him .

0189-002.png	intervene in to normal everyday occurrences .
0189-003.png	He also portrays the rich culture., history and

0189-005.png	his native country of Colombia in both
0189-006.png	his works , " love in the Time of Cholra " and
0189-007.png	" One Hundred Years of Solitude " he incorporates
0189-008.png	all these elements . " Love in the Time of
0189-009.png	Cholra " is not as rich in magical
0189-010.png	realism as the letter works . It emphasis
0189-011.png	more on a romantic relationship with
0189-012.png	Latin America as a break drop . However ,
0189-013.png	it has successfully been made into a

0190-000.png	Postcolonialism :
0190-001.png	postcolonialism , is the critical academic
0190-002.png	study of the cultural legacy of colonialism
0190-003.png	and imperialism , focusing on the
0190-004.png	human consequences of the control
0190-005.png	and exploitation of colonized

0191-000.png	psychoanalytical theory
0191-001.png	the self , the 'O'ther & the 'O'ther
0191-002.png	Today , I have read an article about
0191-003.png	psychoanalytical theory . it tells us about
0191-004.png	the concept of the self , and the 'O'ther and
0191-005.png	the 'o'ther . Self is the central
0191-006.png	figure of oneself . The 'O'other is the
0191-007.png	ideal and the 'o'ther is the
0191-008.png	replica the image created by the
0191-009.png	self . How these all are related ?
0191-010.png	Let's take an example of a child . A
0191-011.png	child always considered himself as the
0191-012.png	central figure of the picture but they
0191-013.png	always need the care of their parents
0191-014.png	which indicates that they ( parents ) love ideal .
0191-015.png	But when a child looks in the mirror ,
0191-016.png	they can see their # own image . They think
0191-017.png	that the image in the mirror is dependent on
0191-018.png	them as it appears and shows #movement when
0191-019.png	the child comes infront of the mirror . This
0191-020.png	shows that the #image in the mirror is the 'o'ther .
0192-000.png	" And Then There Were None "
0192-001.png	we have did the novel " And
0192-002.png	then there were none " written by
0192-003.png	Agatha Christie . This novel is
0192-004.png	about human psychology , like
0192-005.png	there are ten strangers who
0192-006.png	have different psychoanalytical
0192-007.png	disorder . there is the character
0192-008.png	whose name is Mr. Justice
0192-009.png	Wargrave . He is , we can say
0192-010.png	psycho man , who killed or
0192-011.png	murdered the ten strangers
0192-012.png	because he thought he is
0192-013.png	doing justice to them .
0192-014.png	He done such an immoral
0192-015.png	and unethical action . And at
0192-016.png	the last of the novel we
0192-017.png	see that the justice himself
0192-018.png	has being murdered .
0193-000.png	Criticism is a literary subject in which we evaluate
0193-001.png	ans criticise the literary texts , It is taught to
0193-002.png	us by six Basheur . We are not really good in
0193-003.png	criticism . In this subject , we study the works of
0193-004.png	Plato , Aristotle , longinus and Sir philiph sydney .
0193-005.png	We are recently learning Aristotle " Poitics ". In
0193-006.png	poitics Aristotle has talked about Art , tragedy
0193-007.png	and types of tragedies . According to him , Art
0193-008.png	is imitation of nature and action of man . And
0193-009.png	he defines tragedy as " imitation of an action
0193-010.png	serious in nature , complete on itselt , written in
0193-011.png	# dialogue not narrative form , rising pity and
0193-012.png	fear as to attain the Catharsis of emotion ." He
0193-013.png	has also mentioned types of poetry i.e Epic ,
0193-014.png	comedy and mock epic It is really interesting
0193-015.png	and we hope to attain a good GPA in it .
0193-016.png	I will try to read alot to be goot in
0193-017.png	criticism .
0194-000.png	THE SELF , THE OTHER , THE oTHER .
0194-001.png	Frantz Fanon is a post colonial psychologist . He
0194-002.png	developed the theory of the self , # The other ,
0194-003.png	The other . In order to explain his theory ,
0194-004.png	he takes the idea of Jacque lecon theory .
0194-005.png	Jacque is also a psychoanalytic theorist . He
0194-006.png	explain the basic frame work of imaginary ,
0194-007.png	symbolic and the Real .
0194-008.png	In imaginary order, the child develops the
0194-009.png	recognition of his existence . the imaginary,
0194-010.png	order is further divided into two stages . The
0194-011.png	first is proceeding stage and second is
0194-012.png	Mirror stage .
0194-013.png	In Mirror stage the child develops the
0194-014.png	idea that image he sees in the mirror is not
0194-015.png	his reflection rather this is someone else who
0194-016.png	appears when child appears and he makes
0194-017.png	the same movements as child makes . child
0194-018.png	believes that The image he sees in mirrors
0194-019.png	depends upon his existence . through this
0194-020.png	theory Frantz Fanon develops his idea .
0195-000.png	Popular fiction
0195-001.png	( Q ) what is the major difference between literary and popular fiction ?
0195-002.png	Popular fiction is different from other pieces of
0195-003.png	literature . Unlike literary awards , popular fiction is
0195-004.png	intended to gain popularity . It's s primary purpose is
0195-005.png	to entertain . It should be such that it is sold
0195-006.png	in huge numbers . Popular section is industry based
0195-007.png	writers like John Green , J.K. Rowling , Stephen King .
0195-008.png	Jeniffer Niuen , Agatha Christie and J.R.R. Tokien
0195-009.png	are considered as popular fiction writers . when they write , the
0195-010.png	write with the intention of entertaining the readers , but they
0195-011.png	are also concerned with the purpose of having their book
0195-012.png	become a best seller . one major difference between popular
0195-013.png	fiction and literary fiction is that popular fiction is intended
0195-014.png	for the common reader while literary fiction is intended for
0195-015.png	a specific class of readers . Literary works such as The lighthouse
0195-016.png	cannot be understand by readers who is not familial with the
0195-017.png	approach of stream of consciousness . On the other hand , popular
0195-018.png	fiction such as ' The Hobbit ' can be understood by even a child .
0196-000.png	Don't eat the eyes of

0196-007.png	makes the sky shy , by comincing
0196-008.png	to your glory .

0207-000.png	Nelson Mandela who was born in South
0207-001.png	African village named as Qunu where education
0207-002.png	was not given importance . Fields of crops were
0207-003.png	there a lot in which all the people of
0207-004.png	that village took interest . # Mandela also
0207-005.png	practiced in such activities in fields .
0207-006.png	His village name was Ralahlaha . One day a
0207-007.png	stranger visited that village and saw Mandela
0207-008.png	writing something on the ground . He saw
0207-009.png	something in him . He met with his father
0207-010.png	but he refused the stranger that Ralahlahla
0207-011.png	will not study . One day, Mandela's father was
0207-012.png	not # feeling well . So , he told his son that
0207-013.png	you have the permission to go & study .
0207-014.png	Then he joined a circumcision school where

0209-001.png	I have recently read a book name as " Every thing
0209-002.png	is Fucked " by Markmanson . In this book Mark Manson
0209-003.png	is telling about hope . In one of the chapter of the
0209-004.png	book he is telling about Newtons life and his laws of
0209-005.png	Motion . he relate it with other Universe which he
0209-006.png	called it as parallel Universe and he describe the
0209-007.png	emotions and childhood of newton in this book . He also
0209-008.png	# relate Newtons laws of Motion #with Newtons
0209-009.png	Law of Emotions and In this law he describe
0209-010.png	the # truth of the World .
0210-000.png	Post modern fiction is a broader phenomenon
0210-001.png	that moves from a modernism . Basically , it is the
0210-002.png	most ambbigous and complex phenomenon which
0210-003.png	has rejected all the meta narratives of modernism
0210-004.png	and takes the minority and marginalized groups
0210-005.png	into account . Furthermore , in post modern literature ,
0210-006.png	we have post modern fiction i-e science fiction
0210-007.png	which deals with the multiple truths or lies .
0210-008.png	The most important feature of post modern
0210-009.png	fiction is parody and pastiche . Parodly is basically
0210-010.png	the immitating style or manneres of particular
0210-011.png	writes about original work to radicule it . It simply
0210-012.png	highlights the flaw to make it correct . Pastiche
0210-013.png	on the other hand is to combine together multiple
0210-014.png	elements which in a sense is the reworking on
0210-015.png	already existing work . Inshort , post modernism
0210-016.png	is a shift from modernism in all sense . Acco-
0210-017.png	rding to Jean Francios Lyoterd :
0210-018.png	" incredulity towords metanarratives . "
0211-000.png	We have read a topic before ma'am
0211-001.png	teaches as with proper introduction .
0211-002.png	Like ma'am give us proper # heading ,
0211-003.png	for the purpose that we understand
0211-004.png	properly sequence wise - In the topic
0211-005.png	we study about the the concept
0211-006.png	given by ' frantz fanon ' the self , the
0211-007.png	Other , the other - we study this very concept
0211-008.png	with the help of Jacque Lacan phycho
0211-009.png	- analytical theory - There is Imagary order in
0211-010.png	which we study how the child develop
0211-011.png	images in the very early age . That how
0211-012.png	the child develop a sense of its own
0211-013.png	body - when the child is infront of a
0211-014.png	mirror did not recognise firstly then
0211-015.png	he staring at the mirror and then develop
0211-016.png	an image that there is another person who
0211-017.png	live in the same house . So going through
0211-018.png	this the child learn sense of image development .

0234-004.png	whatever he or she wants . Will power is the
0234-005.png	key of every power . In the lesson the " last
0234-006.png	leaf " there was an artist who always wanted
0234-007.png	to make a master piece but their was
0234-008.png	no chance for him but in the last he

0236-004.png	MAIN POINTS :-
0236-005.png	According to this model :
0236-006.png	1) Specific key can open only a specific
0236-007.png	lock .
0236-008.png	2) In the same manner a specific enzyme
0236-009.png	can transfer only one su substrate into

0236-011.png	3) Each enzyme #has a particular active
0236-012.png	site , into which specific substrate
0236-013.png	fits exactly .
0236-014.png	4) According to this model the active site
0236-015.png	has a rigid structure .
0236-016.png	5) There is no modification in the active

0240-001.png	Allama Muhammmad Iqbal was a poet philosopher , and thinker
0240-002.png	who wrote many books to create the the sense of ' khudi '
0240-003.png	( self-esteem ) among the downtrodden muslim ummah . He wrote
0240-004.png	many poems to awaken the minds of the Iindians muslims ,
0240-005.png	who had resigned themselves to their destined fate .
0240-006.png	Allama muhammad Iqbal delivered the presidential Address
0240-007.png	at all-India Muslim League's Annual Session held at Allabad
0240-008.png	on 29 december , 1930 . This speech demarcated a clear pathway
0240-009.png	for indian Muslim towards the road to independence . He
0240-010.png	defined the muslims of india as a nation , and suggested
0240-011.png	that there could be no possibility of peace in the country
0240-012.png	unless they were recognized as a nation . As a permanent
0240-013.png	solution to the Hindu - Muslim problem , Allama Iqbal proposed
0240-014.png	that the panjab , North west frontier province , Balochistan , and
0240-015.png	Sindh , and all muslim majority areas , Should be declared
0240-016.png	self-governing bodies , within or outside the British Empire #
0240-017.png	According to him this was the only solution to the communal

0256-010.png	science
0256-011.png	two types of science
0256-012.png	(1) physical Science :-
0256-013.png	the study of non-living

0257-000.png	The minimum amount of energy
0257-001.png	required to remove an electron
0257-002.png	from the isolated gaseous at is
0257-003.png	called electronegitivity . Here are some
0257-004.png	factor which effect the electro
0257-005.png	negativity . When we go in group
0257-006.png	from left to right then the

0258-012.png	product like Momentum . and
0258-013.png	many other vector quantity .
0258-014.png	it is also called

0259-000.png	A satellite is an orbit that
0259-001.png	passes over the North and
0259-002.png	South Poles of earth . When it is

0259-004.png	the highest point of its #
0259-005.png	orbit , 1000 miles above the earth's
0259-006.png	surface . Above the # North Pole

0260-004.png	matter , energy and their mutual
0260-005.png	relationship is called physics .
0260-006.png	I have many # friend but
0260-007.png	Basir Khan is my best friend .
0260-008.png	My parents is my heart .
0260-009.png	calculus is the branch of
0260-010.png	Mathematics which deals
0260-011.png	the derivative and integration of
0260-012.png	of a # function .
0260-013.png	I like attitude but I
0260-014.png	don't like anyone like
0260-015.png	my fast friend
0260-016.png	Biology is the branch of #
0260-017.png	science which deals with the
0260-018.png	study of living and non-living
0260-019.png	things .
0261-000.png	Another important property
0261-001.png	of water is adhesion , or the
0261-002.png	attraction # between water molecules
0261-003.png	and molecules of other substances
0261-004.png	or objects . This attraction is
0261-005.png	Sometimes Stronger than water's
0261-006.png	cohesive forces , especially when
0261-007.png	water is exposed to charged
0261-008.png	surfaces such as glass walls
0261-009.png	of capillary tubes ( narrow glass
0261-010.png	tube . This is because the water
0261-011.png	molecules are attracted to the
0261-012.png	charged glass walls of the tube
0261-013.png	More than they are to each other
0261-014.png	and , therefore , adhere to the tube .
0261-015.png	This type of adhesion is called
0261-016.png	capillary action .
0262-000.png	Some of the water that falls as
0262-001.png	Precipitation can infiltrate into the
0262-002.png	ground and become part of ground-
0262-003.png	water . Infiltration is the process by
0262-004.png	which water enters the subsurface
0262-005.png	by gravitation # pull . Some of the
0262-006.png	water infiltrates into the ground and
0262-007.png	replenishes aquifers ( saturated subsurface
0262-008.png	material ) , which store huge amounts
0262-009.png	of freshwater for long periods of
0262-010.png	time . Some infiltration stays close to
0262-011.png	the land surface and can seep back into
0262-012.png	# surface-water bodies ( and the ocean )
0262-013.png	as groundwater discharge , while some
0262-014.png	groundwater finds openings in the
0262-015.png	land # surface and emerges as
0262-016.png	freshwater springs . Water that stays
0262-017.png	in the soil closer to the # surface
0262-018.png	can be absorbed through plant .
0263-000.png	There are three main sectors that use
0263-001.png	water - industrial , agricultural , and domestic .
0263-002.png	When water is removed from its source
0263-003.png	such as river or lake and returned to
0263-004.png	this source after use , this is
0263-005.png	referred to as non-consumptive use . An
0263-006.png	example is when water is used
0263-007.png	to in industrial cooling , it may
0263-008.png	be temporarily placed in cooling ponds
0263-009.png	and later returned back to the river
0263-010.png	or lake that it came from . Consumptive
0263-011.png	use is when water is taken out
0263-012.png	from a source and consumed by
0263-013.png	plants and animals or used in industrial
0263-014.png	processes . The water enters animal tissue
0263-015.png	or becomes part of industrial products
0263-016.png	or evaporates during use and is
0263-017.png	not returned to its source . # #
0264-000.png	About 97 of the available
0264-001.png	fresh #water is found below
0264-002.png	the surface as groundwater .
0264-003.png	Groundwater is not created
0264-004.png	by #some mysterious process
0264-005.png	below ground #but is the
0264-006.png	part of the recycled water
0264-007.png	in the hydrologic cycle .
0264-008.png	When precipitation falls , some of
0264-009.png	the water runs off on the
0264-010.png	surface while some infiltrates into
0264-011.png	the ground . Groundwater is replenished
0264-012.png	when water moves from the
0264-013.png	surface , through unsaturated rocks or
0264-014.png	sediments ( unsaturated zone ) , all the
0264-015.png	way down to the saturated
0264-016.png	parts ( saturated zone ) and becomes
0264-017.png	groundwater . The top of the saturated
0265-000.png	As you have probably already
0265-001.png	guessed , oceans are an important component
0265-002.png	of the hydrologic cycle because they
0265-003.png	store majority of all water on earth
0265-004.png	( about 97 ) . Most of the major rivers
0265-005.png	drain into them . The five oceans covering
0265-006.png	the surface of the Earth are the
0265-007.png	Atlantic , Indian , Pacific , Arctic & the
0265-008.png	Southern Ocean . Approximately 90 of
0265-009.png	the water that # is evaporated into
0265-010.png	the hydrologic cycle comes from
0265-011.png	the ocean . Oceans are an important
0265-012.png	and large part of the hydrologic cycle ,
0265-013.png	with lots biological diversity and many
0265-014.png	landforms . They face threats from human
0265-015.png	activities including pollution and
0265-016.png	overfishing .
0266-000.png	A wetland is an area which is
0266-001.png	home to standing water for notable parts
0266-002.png	of the year , has saturated soils for a
0266-003.png	large part of the year and has plants
0266-004.png	that are adapted to surviving under
0266-005.png	flooded conditions or in saturated soils .
0266-006.png	They are transitional areas between the
0266-007.png	terrestrial land and the aquati
0266-008.png	environments such as rivers , lakes , and
0266-009.png	oceans . Some major #wetland types
0266-010.png	include swamps ( dominated by trees ) ,
0266-011.png	marshes ( dominated by non-woody plants ) ,
0266-012.png	and bogs ( dominated by moss) . Wetlands
0266-013.png	are identified using three characteristics :
0266-014.png	soils ( water-saturated soils # are
0266-015.png	present ) , hydrology ( shallow water table )
0266-016.png	and vegetation ( wetland plants that
0266-017.png	are adapted to areas that are saturated
0266-018.png	with water for long periods of time ) .
0267-000.png	Water has the highest specific heat
0267-001.png	capacity of any substance that naturally
0267-002.png	exist as liquid at room temperature
0267-003.png	and # pressure . Water's high
0267-004.png	heat capacity is a property caused
0267-005.png	by hydrogen bonding among the
0267-006.png	molecules . Specific heat is defined
0267-007.png	as the amount of heat one gram of
0267-008.png	a substance must # absorb or lose
0267-009.png	to change its temperature by one degree
0267-010.png	Celsius . For water , this amount is
0267-011.png	one calorie . Other substances have
0267-012.png	lower heat capacities compared to
0267-013.png	water , for example : oil 0.4 calorie ,
0267-014.png	For example , because # the specific
0267-015.png	heat capacity of water is about
0267-016.png	five times more than that of sand , dry
0267-017.png	sand at the beach heats up faster
0267-018.png	than the water but is also cools down
0267-019.png	faster than the water .
0268-000.png	The United States of America ( US ) has
0268-001.png	numerous rivers that run throughout the nation's
0268-002.png	landscape . These rivers are important sources
0268-003.png	of water for cities and their populations .
0268-004.png	The rivers also contain important biological
0268-005.png	communities and provide opportunities for
0268-006.png	recreational activities such as swimming ,
0268-007.png	fishing , canoeing , and white-water rafting
0268-008.png	among others . Rivers largely control
0268-009.png	settlement patterns all over the world due
0268-010.png	to their widespread distribution and
0268-011.png	being an easily accessible source of
0268-012.png	water . Major cities , communities , factories ,
0268-013.png	industries , and power stations are
0268-014.png	located along rivers . It is , therefore , very
0268-015.png	important to protect the quality and
0268-016.png	integrity of rivers all over the
0268-017.png	world .
0269-000.png	Atmosphere and Precipitation
0269-001.png	Precipitation is water released from
0269-002.png	clouds in the form of rain ,
0269-003.png	freezing rain , sleet , snow , or hail .
0269-004.png	It is the primary connection in
0269-005.png	the water cycle that provides for
0269-006.png	the delivery of atmospher#ic
0269-007.png	water to the Earth . Rain
0269-008.png	forms as water vapor in a rising
0269-009.png	air mass condenses in the cloud
0269-010.png	and form water drops . Condensation
0269-011.png	is the process in which water
0269-012.png	vapor in the air is changed
0269-013.png	into liquid water . Condensation is crucial
0269-014.png	to the water cycle because it is
0269-015.png	responsible for the formation of
0269-016.png	clouds . These clouds may produce
0269-017.png	precipitation , which is the primary route for
0269-018.png	water to return to the earth's surface
0269-019.png	within the water cycle . Condensation
0269-020.png	is the opposite of evaporation .
0270-000.png	Human structures such as buildings and roads can
0270-001.png	reduce # infiltration and water-storage capacity of
0270-002.png	floodplain soils leading to increased flood frequency
0270-003.png	and intensity . Some agricultural practices , such as
0270-004.png	rice farming , are typically not associated with
0270-005.png	these negative impacts and are therefore not
0270-006.png	restricted in most floodplains . Properly functioning
0270-007.png	floodplains reduce the negative impacts of floods
0270-008.png	( by reducing severity of flood ) , and they assist in
0270-009.png	filtering stormwater and protecting the water
0270-010.png	quality of rivers . They also act as areas of
0270-011.png	recharge for groundwater . The United States of
0270-012.png	America ( US ) has numerous rivers that run throughout
0270-013.png	the nation's landscape . It is estimated that the
0270-014.png	US has over 200,000 rivers with the Mississippi
0270-015.png	River being the largest by volume despite
0270-016.png	it only being the second longest .
0271-000.png	The impoundments can trap stream
0271-001.png	sediments resulting in reduced sedi-
0271-002.png	ment supply downstream , as well
0271-003.png	as increased deposition behind the
0271-004.png	dam . This shift in sediments flow
0271-005.png	can disrupt and damage aquatic
0271-006.png	habitats and can increase downstream
0271-007.png	stream erosion due to lack of
0271-008.png	sediment supply . The impoundments can
0271-009.png	also prevent certain aquatic organisms
0271-010.png	from migrating either # upstream
0271-011.png	or downstream , therefore , reducing
0271-012.png	their range and ability to survive
0271-013.png	environmental changes as well cutting
0271-014.png	them off from spawning areas ( e.g
0271-015.png	salmon spawning ) . Construction of
0271-016.png	dams can also result in displacement of
0271-017.png	the local people & loss of traditional lands
0271-018.png	and cultural history to the reservoirs and
0271-019.png	ponds that usually # form behind these impoundments .
0272-000.png	Water also has a high heat of vaporization .
0272-001.png	the amount of energy required to change one
0272-002.png	gram of a liquid substance to a gas . A
0272-003.png	considerable amount of heat energy ( 586 calories )
0272-004.png	is required to accomplish this change in
0272-005.png	water . This Process occurs on the surface of
0272-006.png	water . As liquid water heats up , the
0272-007.png	# # # hydrogen bonding makes it
0272-008.png	difficult to separate Individual liquid water
0272-009.png	molecules from each other , which is
0272-010.png	required for water to enter the gas phase
0272-011.png	( steam ) . Thus water acts as a heat sink
0272-012.png	& requires much more heat to boil
0272-013.png	than liquids such as ethanol , whose
0272-014.png	# hydrogen bonds are weaker .
0273-000.png	Most precipitation falls in the form rain . There
0273-001.png	are three main kinds of rain ; frontal , convect-
0273-002.png	ive and orographic . Frontal rainfall is
0273-003.png	precipitation formed when two air fronts
0273-004.png	of different temperatures and moisture
0273-005.png	content converge . Convective rainfall is
0273-006.png	formed when intense localized heating
0273-007.png	causes hot moist air to raise and
0273-008.png	condense and form rain clouds . Intense
0273-009.png	rain would then fall as the clouds
0273-010.png	get supersaturated . Orographic rainfall
0273-011.png	is rain that form over mountains . When
0273-012.png	a moist air mass encounters a mountain , it
0273-013.png	# rises & cools . As it cools water vapor
0273-014.png	condenses to form rain cloud that produces
0273-015.png	rain of the windward side of the mountain .
0273-016.png	Most of the rain ends up as surface water
0273-017.png	runoff . Surface water is a major component
0273-018.png	of the hydrological cycle & one that we
0274-000.png	Evaporation is the process by which water
0274-001.png	changes from a liquid to a gas or #vapour
0274-002.png	Evaporation is the primary pathway that
0274-003.png	water takes from the liquid state back
0274-004.png	into the water cycle as atmospheric
0274-005.png	water vapour . Nearly 90 of moisture in
0274-006.png	the atmosphere comes from evaporation ,
0274-007.png	with the remaining 10 # coming
0274-008.png	from transpiration . Transpiration is the
0274-009.png	process by which moisture is carried
0274-010.png	through plants from roots to small
0274-011.png	pores ( stoma ) on the underside of leaves ,
0274-012.png	where it changes to vapour and
0274-013.png	is released to the atmosphere . Transpiration
0274-014.png	is essentially evaporation of water from
0274-015.png	plant leaves .
0275-000.png	Biomass in the carbon cycle , including
0275-001.png	plants and animals , is the reservoir of
0275-002.png	carbon that we are most likely most
0275-003.png	familiar with , and also the reservoir that
0275-004.png	is most readily available to us . We all
0275-005.png	participate in the flux of consumption
0275-006.png	of carbon when we eat food . All of
0275-007.png	our food is simply plant and / or
0275-008.png	animal biomass . Our body takes the
0275-009.png	carbon molecules contained in this
0275-010.png	biomass , and uses them , along with
0275-011.png	the oxygen we breathe in , for cellular
0275-012.png	respiration to create the # adenosine
0275-013.png	triphosphate ( ATP ) we need for
0275-014.png	energy . The products of cellular
0275-015.png	respiration include the CO2 we
0275-016.png	exhale , water , and energy that
0275-017.png	is stored in ATP .
0276-000.png	Since water polar molecule with slightly positive
0276-001.png	and negative charges , ions and polar
0276-002.png	molecules can dissolve in it . Water
0276-003.png	is therefore , referred to as a universal
0276-004.png	solvent because it is capable of dissolving
0276-005.png	more substances ( polar substances ) Than
0276-006.png	any oTher liquid the charges attracting
0276-007.png	each other ) causing The substance to
0276-008.png	be pulled apart and dissolve in the
0276-009.png	water This is vary important as the
0276-010.png	enables # water to dissolve various chemicals
0276-011.png	and distribute them within living organism
0276-012.png	including taking toxic subsatances out of
0276-013.png	living # # # # things ,
0276-014.png	and in the environment .
0277-000.png	The largest percentage of water withdrawn
0277-001.png	in the US goes to thermoelectric cooling . In
0277-002.png	some countries , such as Egypt , irrigation accounts
0277-003.png	for over 70 of water withdrawn . Irrigation
0277-004.png	is water that is applied by a water
0277-005.png	system to sustain plant growth . Irrigation
0277-006.png	also includes water that is used for
0277-007.png	frost protection , application of chemical ,
0277-008.png	weed control , field preparation , crop cooling ,
0277-009.png	harvesting , dust suppression , and leaching salts
0277-010.png	from the root zone . Water is being
0277-011.png	used at very #high rates throughout
0277-012.png	worldwide due to human population growth
0277-013.png	and industrialization . As more countries
0277-014.png	become affluent ( increase in industrialization
0277-015.png	and standard of living ) they consume
0277-016.png	more water than they did when
0277-017.png	they were less industrialized .
0278-000.png	Since hydrogen bonds need to be broken
0278-001.png	for water to evaporate , a substantial
0278-002.png	amount of energy is used in the
0278-003.png	evaporation process . As the water evaporates ,
0278-004.png	energy is transferred from one source
0278-005.png	and taken up by the process , cooling
0278-006.png	the environment where the evaporation is
0278-007.png	taking place . In many living organisms ,
0278-008.png	including humans , the evaporation of
0278-009.png	sweat ( which is 90 percent water ) allows
0278-010.png	the organism to cool when significant
0278-011.png	heat energy is transferred from the
0278-012.png	organism to the water in the sweat ,
0278-013.png	helping to maintain a constant
0278-014.png	body temperature , a process known
0278-015.png	as homeostasis .
0279-000.png	The crystalline structure , ice , has a more
0279-001.png	open structure than the liquid #form
0279-002.png	of water . The open structure of ice
0279-003.png	makes ice less dense than liquid
0279-004.png	water . The lower density of ice ,
0279-005.png	causes it to float on the surface
0279-006.png	of liquid water . This phenomenon is
0279-007.png	exemplified by icebergs in the
0279-008.png	ocean and ice cubes in a
0279-009.png	glass of ice water . When lakes
0279-010.png	and ponds experience Freezing
0279-011.png	temperatures the top water
0279-012.png	molecule will cool first and form
0279-013.png	ice . Since ice is less dense
0279-014.png	than liquid water , the ice will
0279-015.png	stay on the surface of the pond
0279-016.png	creating an insulating barrier
0279-017.png	that keeps the water below #
0280-000.png	The Physical State of Water on Earth .
0280-001.png	Water on Earth can naturally exist in three
0280-002.png	states of matter , solid , liquid or gas depending on
0280-003.png	prevailing temperature and pressure conditions .
0280-004.png	Majority of water on Earth's surface exists in
0280-005.png	liquid form which is one of the reasons why #Earth
0280-006.png	is capable of supporting life . When heat is added
0280-007.png	to liquid water ( increasing temperature ) the kinetic energy
0280-008.png	of water , the heigher kinetic energy of back up
0280-009.png	the hydrogen bonds . As more heat is added to
0280-010.png	boiling water , the higher kinetic energy of
0280-011.png	the water molecules # causes the hydrogen
0280-012.png	bonds to break completely and allow individual
0280-013.png	molecules to escape into the air as water
0280-014.png	vapor ( gas ) . On the other hand , when the temperature
0280-015.png	of liquid water is reduced and water freezes ,
0280-016.png	water molecules form a crystalline structure maintained
0280-017.png	by hydrogen bonding .
0281-000.png	In addition to greenhouse gases , other manmade
0281-001.png	changes may be forcing climate change . Increases
0281-002.png	in near surface ozone from internal combustion
0281-003.png	engines , aerosols such as carbon black , mineral
0281-004.png	dust and aviation-induced exhaust are acting to
0281-005.png	raise the surface temperature . This primarily
0281-006.png	occurs due to a decrease in the ALBEDO
0281-007.png	of light-colored surfaces by the darker
0281-008.png	colored carbon black , soot , dust , or particulate
0281-009.png	matter . As you know , it is more comfortable
0281-010.png	to wear a white shirt on a hot summer
0281-011.png	day than a black shirt . Why is this ?
0281-012.png	Because the lighter colored material bounces
0281-013.png	more solar radiation back toward space than
0281-014.png	the # darker-colored , allowing it #
0281-015.png	to stay cooler .
0282-000.png	Have you ever filled a glass of water
0282-001.png	to the very top and then slowly added
0282-002.png	a few more drops ? Before it overflows , the
0282-003.png	water forms a dome-like shape above
0282-004.png	the rim of the glass . This water can
0282-005.png	stay above the rim of the glass because
0282-006.png	of the property of # water known as
0282-007.png	cohesion . In cohesion , water molecules are attrac-
0282-008.png	ted to other water molecules ( because of
0282-009.png	hydrogen bonding ) , keeping the molecules together
0282-010.png	at the liquid-gas (water-air) interface
0282-011.png	allowing water molecules to protrude above
0282-012.png	the top surface of the glass . Cohesion
0282-013.png	allows for the development of surface
0282-014.png	tension , the capacity of a substance to
0282-015.png	resist rupture when placed under
0282-016.png	tension or stress .
0283-000.png	Hydrogen Bonds :-
0283-001.png	Due to water's polarity , each
0283-002.png	water molecule attracts other water
0283-003.png	molecules as oppositely charged ends
0283-004.png	of the molecules attract each
0283-005.png	other . When this happens , a weak
0283-006.png	interaction occurs between the positive
0283-007.png	hydrogen end from one molecule
0283-008.png	and the negative oxygen end
0283-009.png	of another molecule . This interaction
0283-010.png	is called a hydrogen bond . As
0283-011.png	water molecules make hydrogen bonds
0283-012.png	with each other , water takes on some
0283-013.png	unique physical and Chemical
0283-014.png	charact#eristics not found in other liquids .
0283-015.png	This hydrogen bonding Contributes to the other
0283-016.png	water properties discussed below .
0284-000.png	A river forms from water moving from higher to lower
0284-001.png	altitude ( elevation ) , under the force of gravity . When
0284-002.png	rain falls on the land , it can seep into the ground ,
0284-003.png	become runoff ( water running on the surface ) , or
0284-004.png	evaporate . Water that moves as runoff on the land
0284-005.png	surface usually converges as it moves towards
0284-006.png	lower elevation . The converging runoff can concentrate
0284-007.png	into single channels of conveyance called creeks ,
0284-008.png	stream , or rivers. usually these #start as small rill
0284-009.png	and rivulets that would join up downhill into
0284-010.png	larger creeks , which then become streams later join
0284-011.png	up downstream to form even bigger channels referred
0284-012.png	to as rivers . The streams and small rivers that join
0284-013.png	up to form a larger river are called tributaries .
0284-014.png	The land area drained by a river and all its
0284-015.png	tributaries is called a watershed or catchment
0284-016.png	or river basin .
0285-000.png	His First Flight
0285-001.png	One seagull live with his family . He
0285-002.png	don't know how # to fly .
0285-003.png	The family members of family fly in
0285-004.png	search of food but seagull afraid of flying .
0285-005.png	His parents donot give him food because
0285-006.png	they wants to see a seagull flying .
0285-007.png	Seagull trying to fly again and again
0285-008.png	but scared of flying . He think that
0285-009.png	if he fly he fall down . He was very
0285-010.png	hungry #he don't #found #anything to eat . He try to fly
0285-011.png	#every #where in search of food . Because of trying he succecced
0285-012.png	in flying . His parents was very happy
0285-013.png	to see seagull flying . So , the theme
0285-014.png	of this story is that story is that we don't lose hope .
0285-015.png	We try again and again till we reach
0285-016.png	to our # destination . Nothing is imposibles
0285-017.png	if we trying and work hard . Hardworking
0285-018.png	is the key to success .
0286-000.png	Try Again and Hardwork
0286-001.png	Hardwork is the key to success
0286-002.png	Accheivments #without hard work are
0286-003.png	impossiable . Hard work is the most importance
0286-004.png	war to success in the life we are
0286-005.png	fail so we " try Again " once we all
0286-006.png	success . Nothing is esay to be acheived
0286-007.png	in life . he make the best of time
0286-008.png	the life of idlenss is a life of # shame
0286-009.png	and # disgrace . A person who
0286-010.png	hardwork is able to gain success
0286-011.png	A person is hardwork in everywhere
0286-012.png	And everywhere " try Again " . The try
0286-013.png	Again of the key of success . try
0286-014.png	Again is the best # idiea of the
0286-015.png	success in the life . Quiad is the
0286-016.png	best example of hardwork .
0287-000.png	Hard work is key to the success
0287-001.png	The human beings , the best creature , created by God ,
0287-002.png	must have some goals in his / her life #setup by
0287-003.png	his / her in order to be a successful and prosper-
0287-004.png	-ous person . for this , anyone had to workhard
0287-005.png	to get his / her desired goals and aims . Hardwork is
0287-006.png	such as key that can allow us to the great
0287-007.png	and vast world of the success . Everything , to
0287-008.png	be achieved , need sacrifice of comfort rather
0287-009.png	we can't be able to get anything # desired
0287-010.png	by us to achieved . Else , the God had
0287-011.png	also sat up a law that he only help
0287-012.png	those who help themselves . We # could # judge
0287-013.png	the difficulties put# up with the people
0287-014.png	who gained popularity that they used to sacrifi-
0287-015.png	-ce their comforts and everything they posses , in order
0287-016.png	to be so . Hence , this term need to be
0287-017.png	taken into consideration that if we want success
0287-018.png	in our life then it could be achieved only through workinghard .
0288-000.png	Hardwork is The key to success , If we
0288-001.png	see all The successfull peope in the world, they
0288-002.png	did hardWork and whenever they failed in their
0288-003.png	tasks . They try again and again but never left
0288-004.png	their tasks empty . There are many examples in
0288-005.png	our life in which did hard work and # struggle .
0288-006.png	Just like our great leader Quid-e-Azam
0288-007.png	Muhammad Ali jinnah who did very hard
0288-008.png	struggle in The independence of Pakistan
0288-009.png	from in the Hindus and Brittain . He Paitance
0288-010.png	many # difficultes but he
0288-011.png	never left his task empty and he
0288-012.png	did many tries but at last he become
0288-013.png	sucessfull . we can beacome succesful in
0288-014.png	our life if we # don't waste our precious
0288-015.png	time and never left our tasks empty , and
0288-016.png	depend on other tasks . We should do hard
0288-017.png	work to become successful in our life
0288-018.png	so keep the golden words that " Hardwork is key to success .
0289-000.png	## # " Hardwork is Key to succes "
0289-001.png	Hard work is the most important way
0289-002.png	to success . Acheivements without hard
0289-003.png	work are impossiable . An idil person
0289-004.png	can never gain anything if they
0289-005.png	sit and wait for better apportunities .
0289-006.png	A person who workhard is able to
0289-007.png	gain success and happiness in life .
0289-008.png	Nothings is easy to be acheived in
0289-009.png	Life without doing only hard work .
0289-010.png	A person who's work hard Allah did
0289-011.png	not lost his hardwork . And # Allah
0289-012.png	gaves the revenge of hard work .
0289-013.png	The Hard Worker is success in every
0289-014.png	part of life .
0290-000.png	His First Flight :-
0290-001.png	The young seagull was alone on his ledge .
0290-002.png	His brother and sister had already flown away The
0290-003.png	day . They do not fly because they do not attends
0290-004.png	the first flight . the sister and brother tell about
0290-005.png	come and fly with us but they # had feel
0290-006.png	the afried . # Their Parents not suport him because
0290-007.png	they feel they do . The sometimes after the seagull
0290-008.png	have come the brink but no they feel nothing
0290-009.png	Possible but after one day they do they will
0290-010.png	attends the fly / flight and the parents very
0290-011.png	happy the story of seagull give the # successfull
0290-012.png	life ideas . You can try you want to become
0290-013.png	a success . The first flight of seagull being give the
0290-014.png	#happiness of life then the human being give the
0290-015.png	ideas of life . On this story . If work hard and
0290-016.png	try again and again# you make yourself
0290-017.png	independent and sucesfull .
0290-018.png	( Noting is impossible ) . Hard work is the key to # success .
0291-000.png	:- His First Flight :-
0291-001.png	(1) The Young seagull was alone on his ledge
0291-002.png	(2) He had been afraid to fly with them
0291-003.png	(3) But for the life of him he could not
0291-004.png	move .
0291-005.png	(4) Since then nobody had came near him .
0291-006.png	(5) Now there was not a single scrap of
0291-007.png	food left .
0291-008.png	(6) And above him he could see nothing .
0291-009.png	(7) Still they look no notice of him .
0291-010.png	(8) His father was preening the feathers on
0291-011.png	his white back .
0291-012.png	(9) Only his mother was looking at him .
0291-013.png	(10) The sight of the food maddened him .
0291-014.png	(11) But it only lasted a moment .
0291-015.png	(12) He had made his first # flight .
0291-016.png	Good TIMBER
0291-017.png	(1) And always got its share of # rain .
0291-018.png	(2) Never became a forest king
0292-000.png	His first flight :-
0292-001.png	The young seagull was alone
0292-002.png	on his ledge His two brothers and sister had already
0292-003.png	flown away the day before . He had been afraid to
0292-004.png	fly with them . because they feel that his wings
0292-005.png	would never Support him . And His family
0292-006.png	members towards him was indifferent . Taking
0292-007.png	no notice of his hunger , rather taunting and
0292-008.png	Scolding him for his co-wardice . As he
0292-009.png	was starving , they did not give him food .
0292-010.png	because they want to force him to make flight himself and
0292-011.png	search food for his survival . In this way they succeed
0292-012.png	in forcing him to fly . Next day he try flight
0292-013.png	because his family taunt and co-wardice for his afried .
0292-014.png	When he fly , he was afried from fly because think
0292-015.png	that I will fall down and his family and seagull
0292-016.png	was very happy for his first flight .

0377-013.png	university , I would be good critical thinker .
0377-014.png	and I am critical thinker , but

0378-004.png	In the other hand , due to this
0378-005.png	issues all the world has been
0378-006.png	stuck but especially education
0378-007.png	Institution is very effected by

0380-004.png	system is totally destroyable or we
0380-005.png	can say just only for capitalist
0380-006.png	people . Because The poor people they
0380-007.png	# do not afford higher standard schools
0380-008.png	# and the lower school # , means Government
0380-009.png	should are totally have. # before covid-19
0380-010.png	somehow a system of education run
0380-011.png	and the ratio of education was

0380-014.png	Psychologically the students , many of
0380-015.png	the students left schools and colleges
0380-016.png	because what they have need . the
0380-017.png	# Government not provide them . and
0380-018.png	some of them left schools because there

0382-000.png	Essay : Difficulties faced by students during covid 19 :
0382-001.png	A peaceful environment is very important to
0382-002.png	study because in such an environment mind
0382-003.png	of student becomes fresh and a student
0382-004.png	studies well . Covid 19 was a very tough time
0382-005.png	for each and every students . To have a fresh
0382-006.png	mind fresh and deep breath is needed .
0382-007.png	during covid 19 it was mendatory for each
0382-008.png	and everyone to were a face mask . Due
0382-009.png	to that face mask fresh breathing was
0382-010.png	lacking . The other was of punctuality problem .
0382-011.png	when there is lack of punctualness there
0382-012.png	comes mixture of different thoughts in mind .
0382-013.png	This also makes a student's mind unfresh .
0382-014.png	Online classes were arranged but due to
0382-015.png	lack of internet facility in each area
0382-016.png	it was difficult for everyone to take
0382-017.png	the classes .

0413-004.png	thoughts which an Artist explains
0413-005.png	by giving it the shape of Art .
0413-006.png	Besides an Artist I love " Physics "

0414-000.png	Topic :- My favourite hobby
0414-001.png	Hobby is need for everyone to gain
0414-002.png	it , because when a person have hobby
0414-003.png	they are busy with them and they live
0414-004.png	happy and spend a great and entertaing time .
0414-005.png	My hobby is to play a video games .
0414-006.png	In video games my favourite game is
0414-007.png	Pubg . Pubg is an online game . And it is playing
0414-008.png	daily a millions of people accross the world .
0414-009.png	In Pubg people # of different country
0414-010.png	are communicate with each other and they
0414-011.png	exchange about their cultural , language especially the
0414-012.png	daily routine of them . By pubg people can

0415-000.png	B.s program is most important opportunity
0415-001.png	for every student in our country .
0415-002.png	But most of the students # # #
0415-003.png	unaware of it importance , means
0415-004.png	they are unable to recognize this
0415-005.png	very opportunity . And they try to #
0415-006.png	go outside such as peshawar , Islamabad
0415-007.png	etc to get education .
0415-008.png	As we know that most # of our
0415-009.png	people # # can't effort their
0415-010.png	expenditures and problems are created.
0416-000.png	Creativity :-
0416-001.png	In my point of view the School system
0416-002.png	make us less intelligent . Because
0416-003.png	we are forced by our teachers as well as our
0416-004.png	elders to learn only the acedemic subject .
0416-005.png	mostly Science Subject like Biology
0416-006.png	Chemistry and physics . Among the student
0416-007.png	Almost Choose Science Subject , Because
0416-008.png	of It social influence . But few student also
0416-009.png	like other than these subjects like
0416-010.png	english or Urdu literature and History as well .
0416-011.png	But unfortunatly , They does not access
0416-012.png	to there own desire . And due to
0416-013.png	this , They lost their creativity skills
0416-014.png	and ability , This is very important
0416-015.png	Thing about which our teachers & elders
0416-016.png	are not aware .
0417-000.png	My Personal Experience # in co-education .
0417-001.png	When for the first time , I have #come here to
0417-002.png	take admission in BS , I was shocked . Because
0417-003.png	when I heard about # females student
0417-004.png	are also sitting in the same class , I was
0417-005.png	very worried . Therefore I was worried , because
0417-006.png	from the very beginning ( from # nursery
0417-007.png	till intermediate ) I had not faced such
0417-008.png	situation . After a passage of time , I realized
0417-009.png	that I have to # attend these
0417-010.png	classes at any cost . When I start
0417-011.png	going to university , there was no any
0417-012.png	sort of issue from female fellow side .
0417-013.png	# Although , at the beginning I feel

0421-006.png	about the imagination power of Rumi , in
0421-007.png	which a person come to Rumi and asked :
0421-008.png	what you did all night in imagination .
0421-009.png	Rumi replied ; I was playing all night with
0421-010.png	my beloved . So when I lose in that game
0421-011.png	in my imagination , I won on the other hand ,
0421-012.png	when I won in my imagination , I also
0421-013.png	won the game . Why this very Quote , Rumi wants
0421-014.png	to say that when a person imagined some -
0421-015.png	thing or even some-one in their dreams , he/she is
0421-016.png	the creator of the dream . In that dream ,
0421-017.png	whatever he/she lose or win , the victory belongs
0421-018.png	to him/her . In that way , A human being should
0421-019.png	try to approach Allah .

0426-000.png	# Everybody has a way that
0426-001.png	Suits them and there are some
0426-002.png	good ideas on this thread .
0426-003.png	My way would be to just
0426-004.png	start writing things about
0426-005.png	myself , without much self-censoring ,
0426-006.png	just random highlights that come
0426-007.png	quickly to mind . When there's
0426-008.png	a page or so of these , see
0426-009.png	if there are some themes that
0426-010.png	Unite the random thoughts , and
0426-011.png	Collate them to form a random
0426-012.png	thoughts , and collage them to
0426-013.png	form a readiable paragraph . During
0426-014.png	this process , see if some written items
0426-015.png	trigger more of the same or remind
0426-016.png	you of something important that was
0426-017.png	missing , and add it .
0427-000.png	Today I have to write about # myself
0427-001.png	So I start with my name . My name is Malaika .
0427-002.png	I am from Peshawar . I belong a Pukthoon
0427-003.png	family . I am a university student . I
0427-004.png	passed my metric from Forward High
0427-005.png	School in Al grades , then FSC from
0427-006.png	Islamia College Peshawar in A grades
0427-007.png	Now # my BS is in progress . I am
0427-008.png	doing my bachelor in Mathematics from
0427-009.png	ICP . So here some people ask a
0427-010.png	question # that why you choose maths
0427-011.png	as it is a difficult subject so my
0427-012.png	answer at that time is that I am
0427-013.png	interested in mathematics , from start
0427-014.png	maths is my favourite subject . And
0427-015.png	also I want to become a teacher in
0427-016.png	Mathematics . So it's all about my
0427-017.png	introduction . I hope you guys will
0427-018.png	enjoy this after reading this .
0428-000.png	Hello ! My name is Muneeba Asghar . I am a
0428-001.png	BS  Mathematics s#tudent . I was interested
0428-002.png	in Maths that's why I chose to
0428-003.png	graduate in this subject . In start our
0428-004.png	studies were not # tough enough . But
0428-005.png	now its getting harder and harder . I am
0428-006.png	now in 5th Semester . I am facing so
0428-007.png	much trouble in understanding my two
0428-008.png	subjects which are theoretical . Actually I
0429-000.png	My name is Urooj Rizwan . My favourate subject
0429-001.png	is maths . I want to become a doctor of
0429-002.png	maths . That every one call me Dr. Urooj .
0429-003.png	For this purpose I want to get BS in Maths
0429-004.png	form Islamia Universty . I got FSC form
0429-005.png	Islamia College . The language of maths
0429-006.png	is very good and I feel and love the
0429-007.png	language of maths . In maths there are
0429-008.png	many exercises and every exercises have
0429-009.png	many formulas . In other subjects their
0429-010.png	are theory but in maths only remember
0429-011.png	the formula and solve the whole
0429-012.png	exercise very easily . But in other
0429-013.png	subjects the long paragraphs we write
0429-014.png	so it is very boring . So I love the
0429-015.png	subject of maths . In maths their are
0429-016.png	algebra , geometry , calculus . In geometry
0429-017.png	we have angle and we draw the diagram
0429-018.png	and the making of diagram is very
0429-019.png	interesting thing .

0431-006.png	language . As I know myself , I
0431-007.png	am good in writing of peotry .
0431-008.png	I has studied many poets of
0431-009.png	Middle ages as well as modran
0431-010.png	ages . John Keats is one of
0431-011.png	the # great poet of his
0431-012.png	era . I want to explore our

0434-007.png	Australia one day but it seems
0434-008.png	difficult now , because , the level
0434-009.png	of intellect which needs to

0435-008.png	That is the most famous
0435-009.png	and the most beloved preacher
0435-010.png	of Islam . He was one of
0435-011.png	us . That personality name is
0435-012.png	Muhammad ( SAW ) . About whome I
0435-013.png	take that # is my prophet
0435-014.png	Muhammad ( SAW ) . If I talk about
0435-015.png	that personality the whole life
0435-016.png	will be gone but the beauty ,
0435-017.png	honesty and everything which present
0435-018.png	in him would not be finished .
0436-000.png	Life is so beautiful yet it is
0436-001.png	very hard I am not saying
0436-002.png	that I am not a blessed
0436-003.png	person rather I would say
0436-004.png	that I am the most blessed
0436-005.png	person ALLAH has given me
0436-006.png	everything I wish for . but now
0436-007.png	a day life is so hard on
0436-008.png	me I am suffering from severe
0436-009.png	Anxiety and I just can't help
0436-010.png	my self to deal with it some
0436-011.png	times i just feel terrible
0436-012.png	the things that i am going
0436-013.png	through is so weird that i
0436-014.png	can't even explain them properly
0436-015.png	i just feel devasted and
0436-016.png	this feeling is killing me inside
0436-017.png	Each day nowadays is different for me .
0437-000.png	( About Me )
0437-001.png	I am Rubab . My father name
0437-002.png	is sayed ALamdar Hussain . I belong
0437-003.png	to Parachinar for time being .
0437-004.png	I Love my Dad . For me my
0437-005.png	Dad is every thing . From God First of all I
0437-006.png	want my dad life . Whenever
0437-007.png	I am sad there is only dad
0437-008.png	to support me . Whenever I done mistake
0437-009.png	an personal #taught me especially
0437-010.png	my sisters but my dad #
0437-011.png	tells me that " It's not a big
0437-012.png	problem why you sad I am
0437-013.png	with you " so after that
0437-014.png	I feel very happy . InshAllah
0437-015.png	I will become a future doctor only for
0437-016.png	my dad . I have no brothers
0437-017.png	so that's why I wan#t to make my
0437-018.png	self like a son for my dad .
0438-000.png	My self
0438-001.png	I am a girl . I # study in 2nd year
0438-002.png	in my favorite and best college . The aim
0438-003.png	of my life is to become a doctor
0438-004.png	and my thought is not only that
0438-005.png	I must become a doctor and its not
0438-006.png	so important , you must have a 2nd chance
0438-007.png	and may be third because its important
0438-008.png	for our life . And I suggest for everyone
0438-009.png	that life is not only that i become
0438-010.png	a doctor , an engineer etc . In life there
0438-011.png	is many small small happiness that
0438-012.png	is to feel . And I also want #to say that
0438-013.png	why # I become a doctor because
0438-014.png	for the services of poor people as well
0438-015.png	as other but that my aim and
0438-016.png	I take it serious to achieve it .
0439-000.png	It is said that pen is mightir
0439-001.png	Than # sword . But I think # as
0439-002.png	a Pakistani , that # pen has no value .
0439-003.png	Because all pened people , educated , are
0439-004.png	suffering # in mesiries . On the other
0439-005.png	hand the uniformed people are ruling
0439-006.png	us , even they are only F.A passed , but ruling
0439-007.png	Just because of the sword , the gun
0439-008.png	# for example our education , # #
0439-009.png	health , construction , # WABDA , and
0439-010.png	other more department are in control
0439-011.png	of their . So # why we are
0439-012.png	still saying that .
0439-013.png	" Pen is mightier than sword "
0439-014.png	Thus , if you are leaving in Pakistan ,
0439-015.png	Then please # don't rely on
0439-016.png	# such quotation because these are
0439-017.png	meant for developed countries not for the
0439-018.png	corrupt # one .
0440-000.png	The traffic problem is one of the
0440-001.png	common problem in metropolitan

0440-004.png	a big cities . Here the problem

0440-010.png	day by day . and # our government
0440-011.png	are not doing any kind of arrange-
0440-012.png	ment for this problem . if
0440-013.png	government are sleeping than we can
0440-014.png	take a step for solving this problem
0440-015.png	we have to use less vehicles and
0440-016.png	walk by #foot and use animals
0440-017.png	for transport .

0443-002.png	struggle behind that Sir Syed
0443-003.png	Ahmed khan worked for the
0443-004.png	Separate nation . the muslims of

0444-000.png	Absolute power corrupts absolutely . it is implied
0444-001.png	everywhere in this society , from government to
0444-002.png	the people # ( commoner ) of this society .
0444-003.png	People in high governement offices exploite
0444-004.png	People of this socity through the power
0444-005.png	they posses which is given by these people
0444-006.png	of society through casting vote to them . Yet
0444-007.png	they are utilizing it in a corrupt way
0444-008.png	to exploit those people .
0444-009.png	On society level or with in a
0444-010.png	family , if one gets power he/she uses it
0444-011.png	and often result in exploitation . It is
0444-012.png	happining in every section of society .
0444-013.png	In a nutshell , this is proven thing
0444-014.png	that absolute power corrupts absolutely .
0444-015.png	We are witnessing it from top to

0448-016.png	These are my own views about
0448-017.png	the progress and development of
0448-018.png	a country .
0449-000.png	Economical set up of the societies is one
0449-001.png	of the greatest curses in recent times
0449-002.png	what we see in form of crimes in
0449-003.png	society are nearly all product of
0449-004.png	unjustified and uniletral economical
0449-005.png	system . Let suppose , what the so-called
0449-006.png	religious and reformist sector call#
0449-007.png	danger for society - Awrat March - it is
0449-008.png	solely the product of economical system
0449-009.png	we as Man are exploiting the rights

0450-007.png	friends but some is nearly touch our

0450-009.png	in our life even those friends
0450-010.png	who shows the successful # path
0450-011.png	in your future . One real person
0450-012.png	is enough for our life .
0451-000.png	Friend ship :
0451-001.png	Devotion and sincerity are true marks of
0451-002.png	lasting friendship .
0451-003.png	Sidra is my bosom friend . she is very soft spoken ,

0452-000.png	-: Friendship :-
0452-001.png	Friendship is the most delightful feeling that
0452-002.png	can't be denied . Friendship can't be buy
0452-003.png	or can't be shared . When you don't have
0452-004.png	friends in your life , that life will be
0452-005.png	like a null box with nothing in it .
0452-006.png	Friendship means a honestfull releation

0452-008.png	have honest friends in your
0452-009.png	life ( its mean ) have unseen tresure in
0452-010.png	life .
0453-000.png	" Story Friendship "
0453-001.png	There are many relation in the world like
0453-002.png	relation of parents with their childrens ,
0453-003.png	teacher with their students and many other .
0453-004.png	Every relation in this world is expensive and
0453-005.png	beautiful , but if someone understand its importance .
0453-006.png	Our religion Islam also give us message about
0453-007.png	relation . I have also seen many relation in my
0453-008.png	life and I really respect it , but I really
0453-009.png	believe in the relation of friendship . Friends are
0453-010.png	the guys of happiness . When we set with our
0453-011.png	Friends we forget every problem of life . we
0453-012.png	share every thing with friends that we can't
0453-013.png	share with someone else . I had seen a
0453-014.png	beautiful and interesting story in my life .
0453-015.png	i-e :-
0453-016.png	Once there was blind girl whose name
0453-017.png	was Noor and her friend Asma . They were
0453-018.png	very close friends , they were very happy with
0453-019.png	each other . Every time they support each other
0455-000.png	Friend ship
0455-001.png	A friend is need when a friend is
0455-002.png	Ineed . Oneday we have many Repectful friend
0455-003.png	that have sacrifice their head with the
0455-004.png	name of friendship . Today's friend is
0455-005.png	not a friend of anyone Just proudful

0455-007.png	benefit no one have any good friend .
0455-008.png	But Now a day a have no friend

0455-011.png	in the world . In this era Just
0455-012.png	meaning less friend . no one have a
